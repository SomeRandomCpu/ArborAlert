## ArborAlert
A Discord bot that reminds you to do your homework, scraped from https://arbor-education.com/

Website: https://duplicake.fyi/projects/arboralert/

Note this bot is currently insecure, slow, hasn't got many features and is in one file. Keep in mind, it's still in development. It will be run using Docker in the future.

## How to self-host
1. Clone the project from GitHub
2. Rename the file '.env2' to '.env'
3. Set the environment variables in '.env'
4. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (I recommend doing this in a venv)
5. Install firefox and geckodriver
6. Run main.py
7. DM ArborAlert 'setup' and set your username and password
8. DM ArborAlert 'fetch' to scrape your homework
9. You're done!
